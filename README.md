# ENVIROCLOCK
EnviroClock is a simple project using LPC2148 that shows the current time, alarm, and room temperature on an LCD. Users can set or change the time and alarm using a keypad. When the alarm time is reached, a buzzer sounds. The system combines clock, temperature sensing, and alarm features in one easy-to-use device.
